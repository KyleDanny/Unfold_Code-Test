# UNFOLD Code Test

- Task 1: https://codepen.io/KyleDanny/pen/xxPWrda (fetchFromAPI Refactor)
- Task 2: https://codepen.io/KyleDanny/pen/MWOVooE (Form Validator) 
- Task 3: Page Transition (using Next.js && Framer Motion)

Additional: Reflection 

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

After installing dependencies with ```npm install```, start dev server with ```npm run dev``` which will launch the site in the default browser.
It is designed as mobile first, but functional for desktop too. 

Alternatively: demo (link)

## Stack
- Next.js (& React)
- Framer Motion
- FontAwesome
- Deployment via Vercel

## Reflections 
This was a fun assignment. 

My biggest challenge for this assigment was that I had not worked with Next.js or Framer Motion prior to this. Howver, due to Next.js being a development framework built on React, it took very little time to familiarize myself with the basics. 

I'm mostly happy with the result. The majority of the code is relatively well organised. 


#### Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
